Like yes, we are able to think of thousands of hypothetical ways technology (even those inferior to full AGI) could go off the rails in a catastrophic way and post and discuss these scenarios endlessly... and yet it doesn't result in a slowing or stopping of the progress leading there. All it takes is a single group with enough collective intelligence and breakthroughs and the next AI will be delivered to our doorstop whether or not we asked for it. It reminds me of the time I read books in my youth and only 20 years later realized the authors of some of those books were trying to deliver a important life messages to a teenager undergoing crucial changes, all of which would be painfully relevant to the current adult me... and yet the whole time they fell on deaf ears. Like the message was right there but I did not have the emotional/perceptive intelligence to pick up on and internalize it for too long."

                    <p><strong>@15</strong> "In front of the museum was a large garden of jasmine plants, which bloom once every seven years. They had been growing for six years and were due to blossom soon. During the opening of the exhibition Fox cremated these plants with a flame-thrower of the type used in Vietnam to provide the wealthy people who regularly enjoyed the garden with a concrete example of the type of action they supported with their dollars and their complacency. I burned the whole thing with a flamethrower, and it just left a slight border of these plants, and they ended up having to dig them all out, it destroyed them. So, then, the next day when these people came to have their lunch there, it was just a burned-out plot, you know. I mean, it was the same thing that they were doing in Vietnam. Nobody would get excited about napalming Vietnam, but you burn some flowers that they like to sit near, and it’s like…" (<a href="https://sniggle.net/index.php">Sniggle.net</a>)</p>

You wouldn't get one hundred thousand likes or retweets or replies or reactions. Most places had twenty to thirty people at most outside of some piracy or fandom-based IRC chat. You'd log on for an hour, fuck around and then do other things. It's all still there. Those forums with twenty to thirty users still exist, you just got addicted to the big numbers and learned helplessness". (Anonymous, comment on /g/)</p>

[...] Petrarch was one of the first to construct [a private study] unattached to any institutions [...] “Here I gather all the friends I now have or did have, not only those who have proved themselves through intimate contact and who have lived with me, but also those who died many centuries ago, known to me only through their writings.” [...] In their tiny corners of the world, Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Du Bois each in their own ways conjure a utopia of friends, binding together the far and near, the long-ago and recent past into the plenitude of the here and now."

My friend in a trip planning group chat added plane emojis to people’s nicknames to track who had booked their flights. Instead of something more “correct” like using a poll, creating a separate spreadsheet, or even using an app designed for group travel, they reprogrammed our names into a status tracker, which was far more convenient and precisely solved our needs. We form desire paths even in digital space." (<a href="https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers">Spencer Chang</a>)</p>
