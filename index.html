            <p><strong>13. doright - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023554#43028080"> Comment</a> on Hacker News: "US and UK refuse to sign AI safety declaration at summit" //</strong> Something tells me aspects of living in the next few decades driven by technology acceleration will feel like being lobotomized while conscious and watching oneself the whole time. Like yes, we are able to think of thousands of hypothetical ways technology (even those inferior to full AGI) could go off the rails in a catastrophic way and post and discuss these scenarios endlessly... and yet it doesn't result in a slowing or stopping of the progress leading there. All it takes is a single group with enough collective intelligence and breakthroughs and the next AI will be delivered to our doorstop whether or not we asked for it. It reminds me of the time I read books in my youth and only 20 years later realized the authors of some of those books were trying to deliver a important life messages to a teenager undergoing crucial changes, all of which would be painfully relevant to the current adult me... and yet the whole time they fell on deaf ears. Like the message was right there but I did not have the emotional/perceptive intelligence to pick up on and internalize it for too long.</p>
       
            <p><strong>12. Spencer Chang - <a href="https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers"> We're All (Folk) Programmers</a> //</strong> From using Discord as a journaling app to weaving in Word and painting in Excel to selling homecooked goods on Facebook Marketplace, we always find ways to make software work for us, often in a way that‚Äôs considered ‚Äúwrong‚Äù relative to what it was designed or marketed for. My friend in a trip planning group chat added plane emojis to people‚Äôs nicknames to track who had booked their flights. Instead of something more ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù like using a poll, creating a separate spreadsheet, or even using an app designed for group travel, they reprogrammed our names into a status tracker, which was far more convenient and precisely solved our needs. We form desire paths even in digital space.</p>

When you did, sometimes it was hard to find more. Crucially you often had to look for the good stuff ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt just piped into your brain endlessly.
