        <p>A list of things I used to make this site, a <a href="https://indieweb.org/colophon"><u>colophon</u>.
        <p>This website is hand-coded in html and css on a second hand 2019 MacBook Pro running Sequoia 15.0.1 using Visual Studio Code. It is published to the web using GitHub Pages and tested on Mozilla Firefox for Mac and Safari for iOS. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/hjallius/hjallius.github.io"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
        <p>I am sick to bastard death of the “internet”. By this I mean those four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three, which have given rise to the current poverty of digital life; technofeudalism if you will, the platform-economy if you won’t. </p>
        <p>In response, I learnt to code, and I built a website.</p>
        <p>Friday Night Salary Man serves a purpose, being a repository of thoughts and links I want to keep and share, but mostly it exists because I wanted to make it. Really then, I suppose, the whole thing is about presence and having some small corner of the web to overuse commas.</p>
        <p>I wrote it by hand because I wanted complete control over the design and because I enjoy coding. It is designed specifically to be iterative in accordance with the twin philosophies of interfere constantly and never ever ever leave well enough alone.</p>
        <p>This means that I make a lot of changes, often small, and often to fix things I have broken. You can tell when this is happening because I’ll update the status indicator at the bottom of the <a href="./about">about</a> page. </p>
        <p>Oh, I also collect none of your data because I don’t know how to, which is just as well because I don’t want it anyway. </p>
