        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I have been writing Friday Night Salary since November 2024. It is my own small piece of the World Wide Web and I made it by hand because I could. As such it was <s>optimised</s> built on the assumption that it only really needs to look good on my laptop screen. My apologies to insect life and mobile users.</p>
            <p>Take a look around and you'll quickly find that there is no set theme to this place, it exists to exist. As such, I assume it will very quickly become a miscellany of sorts. It is a love letter to the web if you will, and a digital paperweight if you won't; I ask only that you refrain from calling it a blog.</p>
