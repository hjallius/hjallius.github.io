        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Friday Night Salary is a personal website which has been active since November 2024. It is my own small piece of the World Wide Web and I made it by hand because I could. Friday Night Salary Man was <s>optimised</s> built solely for my laptop screen; if it looks good enough to me, it is. My apologies to insect life and mobile users.</p>
            <p>The posts on this website form a sort of miscellany of my own thoughts and the thoughts of the people who have inspired me. In particular, youâ€™ll notice that many of these thoughts revolve around the web, the city, and the way they are used; a digital love letter if you will, and a virtual paperweight if you won't. I ask only that you refrain from calling Friday Night Salary Man a blog.</p>
