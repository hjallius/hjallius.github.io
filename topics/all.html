You wouldn't get one hundred thousand likes or retweets or replies or reactions. Most places had twenty to thirty people at most outside of some piracy or fandom-based IRC chat. You'd log on for an hour, fuck around and then do other things. It's all still there. Those forums with twenty to thirty users still exist, you just got addicted to the big numbers and learned helplessness.</p>

Andrew Hui - <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/machiavelli-and-the-emergence-of-the-private-study/"> “Here I Gather All the Friends” Machiavelli and the Emergence of the Private Study</a> //</strong> Reading is a form of necromancy, a way to summon and commune once again with the dead, but in what ersatz temple should such a ritual take place? [...] Petrarch was one of the first to construct [a private study] unattached to any institutions [...] “Here I gather all the friends I now have or did have, not only those who have proved themselves through intimate contact and who have lived with me, but also those who died many centuries ago, known to me only through their writings.” [...] In their tiny corners of the world, Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Du Bois each in their own ways conjure a utopia of friends, binding together the far and near, the long-ago and recent past into the plenitude of the here and now.</p>

Like yes, we are able to think of thousands of hypothetical ways technology (even those inferior to full AGI) could go off the rails in a catastrophic way and post and discuss these scenarios endlessly... and yet it doesn't result in a slowing or stopping of the progress leading there. All it takes is a single group with enough collective intelligence and breakthroughs and the next AI will be delivered to our doorstop whether or not we asked for it. It reminds me of the time I read books in my youth and only 20 years later realized the authors of some of those books were trying to deliver a important life messages to a teenager undergoing crucial changes, all of which would be painfully relevant to the current adult me... and yet the whole time they fell on deaf ears. Like the message was right there but I did not have the emotional/perceptive intelligence to pick up on and internalize it for too long.</p>

Spencer Chang - <a href="https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers"> We're All (Folk) Programmers</a> //</strong> From using Discord as a journaling app to weaving in Word and painting in Excel to selling homecooked goods on Facebook Marketplace, we always find ways to make software work for us, often in a way that’s considered “wrong” relative to what it was designed or marketed for. My friend in a trip planning group chat added plane emojis to people’s nicknames to track who had booked their flights. Instead of something more “correct” like using a poll, creating a separate spreadsheet, or even using an app designed for group travel, they reprogrammed our names into a status tracker, which was far more convenient and precisely solved our needs. We form desire paths even in digital space.</p>
