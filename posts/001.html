        <u>A Word from the Editor</u>
        <p>A friend told me the other day that on Bennett’s Hill, between the Wellington public house and the offices of a landscape architect, is a thin and deep-shadowed alleyway. </p>
        <p>There, he said, one thousand rats are buried under the pavement, all murdered using a Spear & Jackson Square Head Neverbend Digging Spade.</p>
        <p>That I am inclined to believe this tale is a testament to the prowess of the Spear & Jackson Square Head Neverbend Digging Spade which intelligent readers know to have a solid forged carbon steel head, with an extra long socket for strength, and a hammer finish epoxy coating for improved resistance to rust, scratches, humidity and alkalines in the soil. </p>
        <p>All of which makes it the perfect instrument of justice for a drumhead court-martial of rodents. Twenty-five thousand, four hundred and fifty-seven reviews on ScrewFix just can’t be wrong. - Ed.</p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>A man in the local newspaper said that if you took all of the water in all of the canals in town and put it together, you could make a swimming pool large enough for two million people. </p>
        <p>To this I say, who's got the time to spare?</p>

        <p>The girl on the Talk to Frank poster is attractive, but I think she’s on drugs. </p>

        <p>Q: How did Cannon Hill Park get its name? </p>
        <p>A: The “park” part comes from the large area of land used for public recreation. As for the “Cannon Hill” part, I’m not sure. </p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>On the way to work the other day, I was delayed by a procession of fifty horses. Thank God it wasn’t fifty-one or I might have been late. </p>

        <p>Sirs,</p>
        <p>There isn’t much time. I am being held hostage by a strange man in a dark room. He has taken my phone. My only hope of rescue rests in this letter, the one I’m writing to you now, and that you are hopefully reading.</p>
        <p>You see, my captor has neglected to notice that he has left a single sheet of A4 80gsm paper (possibly purchased from a wholesaler) and a uni-ball UB-157 Eye Rollerball Pen, with a Premium Fine 0.7mm Ballpoint Tip in the room with me. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, I have endeavoured to take the initiative to write to your publication in the hopes that as many of your readers as possible will learn of my plight and come to my aid.</p>
        <p>I must make haste, for I fear my captor is about to return. Consequently, I can confirm to your readership that I am being held a</p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>Overheard at Moor Street Station: "The next train to arrive at Platform 1 will be the 12:25 West Midlands Railways service to Dorridge."</p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>To revive a bee, mix 50ml of Casamgos Blanco Tequila, 25ml of lime juice, and 20ml of Cointreau Triple Sec and shake over ice. Strain into a glass with a pre-salted rim and serve with a wedge of lime.</p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>I love UB40 but I can't stand that UB40 featuring Ali Campbell.</p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>It’s a good job my wife didn’t find out about my <em>other</em> mistress. </p>
        <strong>*******</strong>
        <p>Sirs,</p>
        <p>Why do all the girls I go out with know that Angela chick? </p>
        <p>Yours,</p>
        <p>A hopeless romantic </p>
