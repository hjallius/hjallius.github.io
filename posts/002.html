    <div class="two"><strong>02. Alvvays - Lollipop (Ode to Jim) - Central Park Summerstage, NY 6/26/2019</strong>
        <p>Saw Jim Reid in the corridor /
        And I wondered if he could ever see me that way /
        He was on my list at the grocery store /
        When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain /
        Read your feature in the weekly paper /
        And honestly I found it a little bit bloated /
        Friday we fell through the coffee table /
        And that's when I discovered that my heart exploded /
        How? /
        How? </p>
        <p>You're a lollipop /
        In the form of a lightning bolt /
        You're a lollipop in my hair /
        But I'm a gumdrop /
        Am I ever gonna fit that mold? /
        'Cause I don't have the patience to wait in line for you</p>
        <p>When I came back to apologize /
        You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD /
        I sat next to you on the picnic bench /
        And before I knew it, you were flying next to me /
        I met your baby at the exposition /
        And frankly I found it a little unnerving /
        I let you know when we were driving home /
        And all I can remember is the fact we were swerving</p>
        <p>Lollipop /
        In the form of a lightning bolt /
        You're a lollipop in my hair /
        (How could I ever betray you?) /
        But you're a doorstop /
        When you're lying on the bathroom floor /
        And I don't have the time to wait in line for you /
        (How could I ever betray you?)</p>
        <p>Alter my state to get through this date (You're alone in this picture) /
        (And it swallows me whole) /
        Alter my state to get through this date (You're alone in this picture) /
        Alter my state to get through this date (And it swallows me whole) /
        (You're alone in this picture) /
        Alter my state to get through this date (And it swallows me whole) /
        (You're alone in this picture) /
        Alter my state to get through this date</p>
        <p>You're a lollipop /
        In the form of a lightning bolt (How could I ever obtain you?) /
        You're a lollipop in my hair 
        (How could I ever betray you?) /
        You look like Iggy Pop /
        Circa '73 or '4 (How could I ever obtain you?) /
        But I don't have the time wait in line for you /
        (How could I ever betray you?) /
        Wait for you /
        Wait for you</p>
