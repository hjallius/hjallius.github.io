        <p>When I was a teenager, I had a <a href="https://mountainsofwheeze.tumblr.com/"><u>blog</u></a> on Tumblr. It wasn't anything special, and 99.99% of it was reblogged content belonging to others (the rest was comprised of pitiful <a href="https://mountainsofwheeze.tumblr.com/post/173728240380/the-street-life-of-stacks-and-codeine"> <u>attempts at very-online humour</u></a>.)</p>
        <p>Really, the whole thing was a gloryfied scrapbook of inside jokes, post-ironic shitposts, and weatherbeaten, dada-esque<a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e912cdd65f6ad82b0b9bcf92d98dc7ca/tumblr_org98mXt6k1wqwdg9o1_500.jpg"><u>memes</u></a>. But</p>
        <p>I realise now that what I was actually doing was keeping a commonplace book - shaped humour - still say why are you defending the smell of a ball etc</p>
        <p>Go on to discuss this blog and commonplace books</p>
