        <br><br>
        <p>When I was a teenager, I had a <a href="https://mountainsofwheeze.tumblr.com/"><u>blog</u></a> on Tumblr. It wasn't anything special, and 99.99% of it was reblogged content belonging to others (the rest was comprised of vaguely tenable <a href="https://mountainsofwheeze.tumblr.com/post/173728240380/the-street-life-of-stacks-and-codeine"> <u>attempts</u></a> at very-online humour.) </p>
        <p>The whole thing was a glorified scrapbook of inside jokes, post-ironic shitposts, and weatherbeaten, dada-esque <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e912cdd65f6ad82b0b9bcf92d98dc7ca/tumblr_org98mXt6k1wqwdg9o1_500.jpg"><u>memes</u></a>. It was crude, surreal and esoteric - and hugely important to me. </p>
        <p>It’s only with the benefit of hindsight that I can see my Tumblr for what it really was: a digital commonplace book. There, in that bird’s nest of other people’s witty, if vulgar, gags, my sense of humour began to take shape.</p>
        <p>Commonplace books have a long history, and I don’t propose to rehash it here, save to say that the idea has always been to collect the thoughts and quotes (and I suppose nowadays the websites, images and videos) of others for periodic reflection.</p>
        <p>It’s up to you whether you want to let them speak for themselves, or put your own gloss on them. Commonplacing is, as Michel de Montaigne puts it, gathering the flowers of others.</p>
        <p>That’s exactly what I plan to do here with this site. Maybe it will become a linkblog, that quick and dirty to express yourself through other people; maybe it won't.</p> 
        <p>Either way, I'm going to sow the seeds of others, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i739SyCu9I"><u>let there be a thousand blossoms bloom</u></a>.</p>
